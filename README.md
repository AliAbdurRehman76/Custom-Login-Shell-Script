# 🖥️ Custom Linux Login Script
*A 4th Semester Operating System Project*

This project is a **custom login shell script** (`~/.custom_login.sh`) developed as part of my **4th Semester Operating System (OS) course**. The script personalizes the Linux terminal experience by displaying system information, motivational quotes, and session details whenever a user logs in.
